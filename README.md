## Hey I'm Will ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring software engineer interested in backend or API developement roles! I am based in the Pacific Northwest in Seattle, WA. I am fascinated with the 
process of data modeling, architecting and implementing systems or microservices. I am also a Oracle Certified Associate in Java SE 8 programming and have a background 
in Electrical Engineering.

## What have I been up to? 
I have been cutting my teeth at Bloomtech's Enterprise Backend Developement program that was co-developed by Amazon to supplement my working knowledge of Java as well as 
the learn the development technologies surrounding Java. Currently in the career preparation and applied computer science phase, I will soon be sending out applications!
