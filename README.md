  Remember, the first step in solving any problem is to first recognize that there is a problem. Whether that be mundane-trivial or a systematic rot that has festered 
  for years. It is only then one can start the problem solving process to rectify the circumstance. Having sophisticated search engines that access and filter the world 
  wide network of amalgamatated knowledge certainly helps.
