  Remember, the first step in solving any problem is to first recognize that there is <br>
  a problem. Whether that be mundane-trivial or a systematic rot that has festered <br>
  for years. It is only then one can start the problem solving process to rectify the <br> 
  circumstances. Having sophisticated search engines that can access and filter the world <br>
  wide network of amalgamatated knowledge certainly helps.

  I assume that I do not understand the problem nor the circustances to solve the problem.
